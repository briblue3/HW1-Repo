# HW1 Repo
Publicly shared repository for submitting Homework 1.

Follow instructions from [HW1 web page](http://www.pitt.edu/~naraehan/ling1340/hw1.html).

### More info:
This repository was forked from Na-Rae's HW1 Repo and modified from there as per the assignment instructions. I am not submitting my work for a pull request.
Here is what is different in my work from the general assignment:
- Deleted classmate folders (didn't feel the need to keep them in my repo if I wasn't going to submit a pull request to master)
- Somehow my Notebook checkpoints ended up in the repo, don't know why since they weren't there in my first few commits.
- My data is in my repo since I forked and started committing before the .gitignore file was added. Not concerned since file size is small overall.
